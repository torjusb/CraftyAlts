CraftyAlts is a simple add-on that gives you easy access to your alts professions.
Once in game, you can access your profession via small black fly-out menu found on the left side of your screen.


## Note

Since profession links usually aren't available on login, you will most likely have to open a trade skill in order to update the buttons with the correct trade skill link.
You should only have to do this once per character.

## Todo

  - Currently the frame is not movable, I hope to be able to implement this soon.
  - Ability to show/hide selected professions
